				<p>

				UrbanBucks Corporation is an American coffee company and coffeehouse chain. UrbanBucks was founded in Seattle, Washington in 1971. As of November 2016, it operates 23,768 locations worldwide.

UrbanBucks is considered the main representative of "second wave coffee", initially distinguishing itself from other coffee-serving venues in the US by taste, quality, and customer experience while popularizing darkly roasted coffee.Since the 2000s, third wave coffee makers have targeted quality-minded coffee drinkers with hand-made coffee based on lighter roasts, while UrbanBucks nowadays uses automated espresso machines for efficiency and safety reasons.

<p class="dark">
UrbanBucks locations serve hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, microground instant coffee known as VIA, espresso, caffe latte, full- and loose-leaf teas including Teavana tea products, Evolution Fresh juices, Frappuccino beverages, La Boulange pastries, and snacks including items such as chips and crackers; some offerings (including their annual fall launch of the Pumpkin Spice Latte) are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Many stores sell pre-packaged food items, hot and cold sandwiches, and drinkware including mugs and tumblers; select "UrbanBucks Evenings" locations offer beer, wine, and appetizers. UrbanBucks-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks are also sold at grocery stores.</p>

				<h3>What we Do</h3>
				<p>In 2012, UrbanBucks introduced UrbanBucks Verismo, a line of coffee makers that brew espresso and regular chocolate from coffee capsules, a type of pre-apportioned single-use container of ground coffee and flavorings utilizing the K-Fee pod system.[91] In a brief review of the 580 model, Consumer Reports described the results of a comparative test of the Verismo 580 against two competitive brands: "Because you have to conduct a rinse cycle between each cup, the Verismo wasn't among the most convenient of single-serve machines in our coffeemaker tests. Other machines we've tested have more flexibility in adjusting brew strengthâ€”the Verismo has buttons for coffee, espresso, and latte with no strength variation for any type. And since Urbanbucks has limited its coffee selection to its own brand, there are only eight varieties so far plus a milk pod for the latte</p>
